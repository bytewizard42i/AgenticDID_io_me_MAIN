2. **Usage Patterns:** How to use the system
3. **Deployment:** How to run/deploy
4. **Roadmap:** Clear demo → production path

---

## 💪 Competitive Advantage

**Most Teams Will Have:**
- Code that works
- Basic README
- Some documentation

**You Now Have:**
- ✅ **Extremely well-documented code**
- ✅ **Comprehensive README for every component**
- ✅ **Clear demo vs production distinction**
- ✅ **Professional engineering practices**

**This shows:**
- 🎯 You're serious about this project
- 🎯 You understand production requirements
- 🎯 You respect judges' time (easy to review)
- 🎯 You're thinking beyond the hackathon

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (When You're Back)

### Option 1: Ship It! (Recommended if <24 hours)
The documentation is **excellent** for judges. Focus on:
- Polish the pitch/presentation
- Test the demo thoroughly
- Prepare for questions
- Get ready to submit

### Option 2: Continue Documentation (If you have time)
Add comments to frontend files:
- `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - Main UI component
- `apps/web/src/agents.ts` - Agent configuration
- `apps/web/src/api.ts` - API client

**But honestly:** What's done is already **very impressive**. The backend is what judges will scrutinize most, and it's **thoroughly documented**.

---

## 🏆 Bottom Line

**Your codebase is now:**
- ✅ Professionally documented
- ✅ Easy for judges to review
- ✅ Shows technical depth
- ✅ Demonstrates production mindset
- ✅ Clearly distinguishes demo from production

**This documentation alone:**
- Could win points in **Communication (15%)**
- Could win points in **Quality (15%)**
- Supports your case for **Engineering (20%)**
- Makes judges' jobs easier (they'll remember you!)

**Ready for hackathon submission!** 🎊
