## 📊 **SLIDE-BY-SLIDE CONTENT**

---

### **SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE** (10 seconds)

**Layout**: Title slide

**Content**:
```
🔮 AgenticDID.io

The Identity Layer for Agentic Commerce

Built on Midnight Network
```

**Footer**:
```
EnterpriseZK Labs | Midnight Hackathon 2025
```

**Design**: Purple-to-blue gradient background, white text, crystal ball emoji prominent

**Speaker Notes**:
"AgenticDID is the identity layer for the agentic age - built on Midnight Network with real zero-knowledge proofs."

---

### **SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM** (60 seconds)

**Layout**: Title and body

**Title**:
```
AI Agents Need Identity Too
```

**Content** (Large text, visual focus):
```
🤖 Agents are managing your money, shopping, and healthcare

❓ Who authorizes them?

🔒 Traditional identity fails agents:
   • Built for humans, not AI
   • All-or-nothing KYC
   • No privacy guarantees
```

**Visual**: Large icons showing person with multiple AI agents around them

**Speaker Notes**:
"AI agents are handling sensitive tasks - banking, healthcare, shopping. But current identity systems were built for humans, not agents. They force all-or-nothing KYC with no privacy. We need something better."

---

### **SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION** (75 seconds)

**Layout**: Title and body

**Title**:
```
AgenticDID: Progressive Trust + Zero-Knowledge
```

**Content** (3 key points, large):
```
1️⃣ Self-Sovereign DIDs
   No permission needed. You own your identity.

2️⃣ Progressive Trust Tiers (0→1→2→3→4)
   Start anonymous. Level up as needed.
   Browse (Tier 0) → Shop (Tier 1) → Bank (Tier 3)

3️⃣ Zero-Knowledge Credentials
   Prove you're 18 without revealing your birthday.
   Prove authorization without exposing data.
```

**Visual**: Simple staircase diagram showing tier progression

**Speaker Notes**:
"AgenticDID solves this with three innovations. First, self-sovereign DIDs - you control your identity. Second, progressive trust tiers - start anonymous at Tier 0, level up to Tier 1 for shopping, Tier 3 for banking. No more all-or-nothing KYC. Third, zero-knowledge credentials built on Midnight Network - prove what's necessary, hide everything else. Prove you're 18 without revealing your birthday."

### **SLIDE 4: HOW IT WORKS** (60 seconds)

**Layout**: Title and large diagram

**Title**:
```
Agent-Mediated Identity Flow
```

**Visual**: Large, clear flow diagram:
```
┌──────────┐
│   USER   │ (John)
│  DIDz    │ Controls identity, sets permissions
└────┬─────┘
     │
     ↓
┌──────────┐
│  COMET   │ (AI Assistant)
│ Delegated│ Acts on your behalf
│   Creds  │ with your credentials
└────┬─────┘
     │
     ├──→ 🏦 Banking Agent
     ├──→ 🛒 Shopping Agent
     └──→ 🏥 Health Agent
          │
          ↓
    ┌─────────────┐
    │   SERVICES  │
    │ Verify with │
    │  ZK Proofs  │
    └─────────────┘
```

**Speaker Notes**:
"Here's how it works. You control your DID and set permissions. Your AI assistant Comet gets delegated credentials. Comet sends specialized agents - banker, shopper, health - to services. Services verify using zero-knowledge proofs. Your data never leaves your control."

### **SLIDE 5: MIDNIGHT INTEGRATION** (60 seconds)

**Layout**: Title and body

**Title**:
```
Built on Midnight Network
```

**Content**:
```
✅ Real ZK-SNARK Proofs (not simulated)
✅ Compact v0.26.0 Smart Contracts
✅ Protocol-Level Data Protection
✅ Production-Ready Architecture

🐳 Docker containerized
⚡ Cloud-ready deployment
🔒 Type-safe throughout
⏱️ 5 minutes from clone to running

Why Midnight?

Because when dealing with KYC data, financial 
credentials, and healthcare records, "good enough" 
isn't good enough.
```

**Speaker Notes**:
"This isn't a mock-up. We're using real ZK-SNARK proofs with Compact smart contracts on Midnight Network. The entire stack is production-ready - Docker containerized, cloud-ready, type-safe throughout. You can clone and run it in 5 minutes. We chose Midnight because when you're handling sensitive financial and healthcare data, you need protocol-level privacy guarantees."

### **SLIDE 6: USE CASES & IMPACT** (45 seconds)

**Layout**: Title and 2x2 grid

**Title**:
```
Real-World Applications
```

**Content** (4 quadrants, large icons):

```
🏦 BANKING                    🛒 COMMERCE
Agent transfers funds         Agent shops online
ZK proof of authorization     Age/eligibility verified
Full AML compliance          No personal data exposed

🏥 HEALTHCARE                 🗳️ GOVERNANCE
Access medical records        Digital voting
HIPAA compliant              Identity verified
Emergency credentials        Eligibility proven
```

**Speaker Notes**:
"The applications are immediate. Banking - agents can transfer funds with ZK proofs of authorization. Commerce - agents shop online, verify age requirements, all without exposing personal data. Healthcare - HIPAA-compliant access to records. Governance - verified digital voting. This is the foundation for agentic commerce."

## 🎯 **PRESENTATION TIPS**

### **Delivery**
- **Speak clearly**: Judges are hearing many pitches
- **Use pauses**: Let key points land
- **Make eye contact**: Don't read the slides
- **Show confidence**: You built something real

### **What to Emphasize**
1. **Real ZK proofs** - Not simulated, production-ready
2. **Progressive trust** - Novel approach to KYC
3. **Agent-native** - First-mover advantage
4. **Built on Midnight** - Why this blockchain matters

### **If Running Long**
- Skip detailed architecture (Slide 5 can be shortened)
- Consolidate use cases (Slide 6 can be faster)
- The story is: Problem → Solution → How → Why Midnight → Impact

### **If Asked Questions**
- **Technical depth**: 40+ docs, full architecture
- **Roadmap**: Beyond hackathon (DIDz Protocol, Fi Ecosystem)
- **Competition**: No other DID offers progressive trust tiers
- **Team**: Built in 2 weeks with AI assistance (Cassie)
