## 🔍 Additional Information from CardanoEIA

### Deployment Information
From the CardanoEIA project documentation, we found:

**Current Production Deployments:**
- Platform: Render (Free tier)
- Backend: FastAPI on Python 3.10.12
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (static export)
- Build time: ~3 minutes (optimized)
- Auto-deploy: Enabled on push to `main`

**Tech Stack:**
- FastAPI >=0.115.0
- CrewAI 1.4.1
- Anthropic Claude API
- Blockfrost (Cardano)
- ChromaDB (vector database)

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Resolved major dependency conflicts
- ✅ Optimized build from 45+ min (timeout) to 3 min
- ✅ Production deployment successful
- ✅ MCP integration for AI-assisted DevOps

---

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### Immediately Ready
With the current keys, you can:
1. ✅ Run local development with AI agents (OpenAI/Anthropic)
2. ✅ Connect to Cardano Preprod testnet (Blockfrost)
3. ✅ Use payment service (Masumi)
4. ✅ Start building AgenticDID protocol

### Needs Configuration (Optional)
For production deployment, you'll need:
1. ⚠️ Google Cloud credentials (if using Cloud Run)
2. ⚠️ Vercel tokens (if deploying to Vercel)
3. ⚠️ Render API keys (if deploying to Render)
4. ⚠️ Midnight wallet (for Phase 2 ZK proofs)

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Development (Now)
**Action**: Start with what we have!
- The AI APIs (OpenAI + Anthropic) are production keys
- Blockfrost Preprod is perfect for testing
- You can build the entire protocol locally

### For Deployment (Later)
**Options**:
1. **Render** (like CardanoEIA) - Free tier, easy setup
2. **Google Cloud Run** (for hackathon) - Needs GCP credentials
3. **Vercel** (for frontend) - Needs account setup

**Recommendation**: Start with Render like CardanoEIA since it's proven to work!

### For Phase 2 Midnight Integration
**Action**: Generate new Midnight testnet wallet when ready
- Use Midnight Dashboard: https://testnet.midnight.network
- Or Lace wallet integration
- Document the seed phrase securely

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ **Good practices followed:**
1. `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (verified)
2. No credentials in git history
3. Clear documentation of sources
4. Organized with status markers

⚠️ **Important:**
- These are REAL production keys from CardanoEIA
- Handle with care - do not expose publicly
- Consider rotating keys for production AgenticDID deployment
- Use separate keys for demo vs production
