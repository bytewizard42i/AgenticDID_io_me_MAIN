# 📦 Archive - Historical Documentation

This folder contains documentation that is **historically pertinent** but **no longer actively needed** for development.

---

## Purpose

Files here are:
- ✅ **Historically valuable** - Record of important project milestones
- ✅ **No longer active** - Information superseded by current codebase
- ✅ **Preserved for context** - Future reference if needed

---

## Contents

### **MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md**
- **Date**: November 14, 2025
- **What**: Complete record of protocol migration from DEMO-LAND to REAL-DEAL
- **Why Archived**: Migration is complete, information visible in current structure
- **Historical Value**: Documents the reorganization of contract code

---

## Guidelines

**Move here if**:
- Document is a completion report for finished work
- Information is redundant with current codebase
- Historical context but no active development value

**Keep in main docs if**:
- Actively referenced during development
- Contains current API documentation
- Guides ongoing implementation work
