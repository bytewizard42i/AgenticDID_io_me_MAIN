## 📝 Instructions for Casie

1. Open this file on your machine
2. Fill in the values from your CardanoEIA repo or credential storage
3. Save the file
4. Send it back to John (or paste the content)

**Important**: These are sensitive values! Handle with care.

---

## 🎯 What We'll Do With These

Once we have the keys, we'll:
1. Create a proper `.env` file in the Real Deal repo
2. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (it's already there)
3. Never commit these to git
4. Use them for local development and deployment

---

## ✅ Optional: If You Can Also Grab

If you have these handy, they'd be helpful too:

```
# AI Studio (Google)
GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY=

# Any other APIs you use
OTHER_API_KEYS=
```

---

**Thanks Casie!** 🙏

Once you fill this out, John will transfer the keys to our `.env` file and we'll be ready to build!

**Security Note**: Make sure to send this via secure channel (not public), and we'll delete this file after copying the values.
