# Midnight Proof Server - Local Development
# ============================================================================
# This runs the Midnight Network proof server locally for ZK proof generation
# 
# Purpose: Generate zero-knowledge proofs for credential verification
# Network: Undeployed (local development, no testnet dependency)
# Port: 6300 (standard Midnight proof server port)
# 
# Usage:
#   Start:  docker compose -f docker-compose.proof-server.yml up -d
#   Stop:   docker compose -f docker-compose.proof-server.yml down
#   Logs:   docker compose -f docker-compose.proof-server.yml logs -f
#   Health: curl http://localhost:6300/health
# 
# Note: This runs SEPARATELY from backend services. It's shared infrastructure
#       like a database - multiple services connect to one proof server.
