## Slide 4: The Problem

**SLIDE CONTENT:**

Problem: How do we know our agent is real?

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

The problem we are solving is, in this modern technological age, how can we be sure the agent we are interacting online with is real?

---

## Slide 5: The Mission

**SLIDE CONTENT:**
- 🤖 AI agents are managing our money, healthcare, and shopping
- ❓ Who authorizes them? How do they prove it?
- 🔒 Traditional identity systems are centralized and invasive

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

THE MISSION: If we are to allow AI agents to help us with vital everyday tasks, we must first ensure that they are who they claim to be and not bad actors out to do us harm.

## Slide 6: Solution Introduction

**SLIDE CONTENT:**

Solution

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

So, what is the solution?

---

## Slide 7: The Solution - AgenticDID

**SLIDE CONTENT:**
- Leveraging Midnight ZKPs, we establish trust with a decentralized DApp called AgenticDID
- This revolutionary protocol Creates what we call Trusted Issuers (TI-Vs)

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

Our solution is a decentralized DApp called AgenticDID. Leveraging Midnight Network's zero knowledge proofs, we establish trust between several entities that the DApp facilitates. The first of which is called a Trusted Issuer/Verifier (TI-V).

---

## Slide 8: Trusted Issuer-Verifier Types

**SLIDE CONTENT:**

There are 4 types of trusted issuers that we make:
- Self_Sovereign - Individual
- Corporation - Business entity (LLC, Inc)
- Institution - Non-profit, university, NGO
- Government_Entity - Government Org.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

Our AgenticDID DApp can create 4 different types of Trusted Issuer-Verifiers: Self-sovereign (an individual), corporation (for business entities like LLCs and incorporated companies), institutions (non-profit, universities, and NGOs), and finally Government entities.

---

## Slide 9: TI-V Legitimacy Requirements

**SLIDE CONTENT:**

These trusted issuers must prove to the DApp their legitimacy based on a tiered trust scale:
- Corporations, Institutions, and Government entities must prove they are legitimate

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

To become Trusted Issuers, entities must prove their legitimacy. Self-sovereign Issuer-Verifiers come with a greater measure of leniency to begin, though it can limit their ability to interact with registered agents.

---

## Slide 10: Granting TI-V Status

**SLIDE CONTENT:**
- Trusted Issuer-Verifier status is granted by the AgenticDID DApp
- New Trusted Issuer-Verifier can now create Registered Agents under their organization's name!

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

Once the AgenticDID DApp grants the Trusted Issuer-Verifier status to an entity, it can then create Registered Agents under its name to interact with the public. The reason for the verification is so there is only one TI-V for the real company and greatly reduces the potential for fraud. The list of real organizations is easily verified on the AgenticDID DApp for public entities.

---

## Slide 11: Registered Agents

**SLIDE CONTENT:**
- Trusted Issuer-Verifiers create Registered Agents who your agent can verify by the Trusted Issuer that runs them as well as the AgenticDID DApp
- E.g. Know that you are dealing with your real bank's agent with trust and surety!

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

Trusted Issuer-Verifiers can have Registered Agents that perform tasks and interact with the public with trust. A user can easily verify the validity of a Registered Agent by challenging the proof to the Trusted Issuer-Verifier, or the AgenticDID DApp itself. Your Registered local Agent will do this automatically before connecting.

---

## Slide 12: Our AI Future

**SLIDE CONTENT:**
- As our AI use increases, so will our need for trust
- Zero Knowledge proofs on Midnight will allow KYC compliance without revealing underlying data
- Interact with dignity and privacy

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

As humans and AI become ever more organically entangled, we must begin with a foundation of trust. AgenticDID with Midnight's selective privacy and dual token economic model allows for a seamless customer experience that "Just Works". Whether buying a birthday card on Amazon or scheduling a cancer screening, begin with trust, security, and privacy. AgenticDID Thank You.

## Slide 13: Our DApp Features

**SLIDE CONTENT:**
- Intuitive UI for Users
- Text to speech for wonderful user experience
- Listen in mode for hearing how the agent interacts for vital or sensitive interactions
- Your local agent knows you and your goals and desires

**SPEAKER NOTES:**

Our incredible DApp is the future of interactions between AI and humans. We want assistants and declarative interactions. We want contextually intelligent local agents who can help anticipate and guide us through complicated scenarios. We want agents that are vested in our wellbeing and happiness. AgenticDID is the nexus for all these things with surety, security, and confidence. Thank you.
