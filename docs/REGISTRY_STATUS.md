## 🎯 TD Bank Philosophy Applied

> **"We don't want to make a million checks perfectly.  
> We want to make ONE check perfectly and copy that process."**

**Applied to AgenticDID:**

1. ✅ **Define ALL issuers and agents upfront** - Structure in place
2. 🔜 **Build ONE perfect flow** - agent_0 + trusted_issuer_0 (NEXT)
3. ⏳ **Test with ONE real user** - John's KYC journey
4. ⏳ **Replicate for all others** - Copy agent_0 pattern

**Result:**
- 8 issuers defined (1 active, 7 ready)
- 7 agents defined (1 active, 6 ready)
- Clear implementation path
- No guesswork when scaling

---

**Status**: Registry complete, ready for agent_0 implementation 🚀  
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-14  
**Next**: Build agent_0 (AgenticDID Issuer Agent)
